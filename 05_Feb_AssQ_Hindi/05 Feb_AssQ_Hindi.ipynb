    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint that defines the common properties and behaviors of a group of objects.

In other words, an object is created from a class, and it contains all the properties and methods defined by that class.\n",

When we create an object of this class, we can assign specific values to its properties, such as \"red\", \"Toyota\", and \"Corolla\". We can also call its methods, such as \"start_engine()\" to start the car's engine."
