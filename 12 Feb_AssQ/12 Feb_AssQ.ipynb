    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When a statement or expression encounters an exceptional condition, it raises an exception, which disrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to an exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions provide a way to handle various types of errors and unexpected events in a program. They allow you to gracefully handle exceptional situations and prevent your program from crashing. Python provides a mechanism for raising, catching, and handling exceptions using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error (also known as a parsing error) is a type of error that occurs when you write code that violates the rules of the Python language's syntax. Syntax errors happen during the parsing (or compilation) phase of the program, before it is executed. These errors indicate that the structure of your code is invalid or improperly formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when a specific error condition is encountered, while syntax errors occur during the parsing phase before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cause: Exceptions are typically caused by runtime conditions, such as invalid input, division by zero, or accessing an index out of range. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are caused by violations of the language's grammar rules, such as missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or using an undefined variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover from the error and continue execution. Syntax errors, however, must be fixed by correcting the code before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program and can be used to handle exceptional situations. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all until they are resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are raised during the execution of a program when specific errors occur, and they can be caught and handled. Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur during the parsing phase due to invalid code structure and must be fixed before the program can be executed."
